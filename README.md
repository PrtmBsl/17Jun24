An input dataset was received with multiple features related to individuals. 
The data was cleaned using many techniques and feature engineering was performed. 
Based on a training dataset of probability of an individual of getting an xyz vaccine and a seasonal vaccine, a Logisitic Regression model was trained. 
Split in the training data was done to find the ROC-AUC analysis which gave close to 82 to 85% accuracy based on different ratios of training and testing data splits. 
Finally, the predictions for both the vaccines were made for a separate test data and the answer is stored in the submission file.
